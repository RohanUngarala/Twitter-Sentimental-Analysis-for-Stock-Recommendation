# Twitter-Sentimental-Analysis-for-Stock-Recommendation

The nature of the stock price movement is non linear.The main motivation of our project is to find a way to generate a consistent profit in the stock market which is a challenging task indeed.People are unsure of what stock they should opt at what time to sell or buy it.The main objective behind this project would be to develop a model that would help users decide on which stocks to opt based on the tweets as there is always a correlation between the moods of public and the way the stock market performs.Since machines canâ€™t understand the emotions of the person in this project we use some machine learning algorithms to gauge the mood expressed in tweets. The end deliverable of this project is a financial model that would be built by analyzing the data collected by using Twitter API.The goal is to provide an understanding to people or stockholders about the important features that determine the stock market.In this process we are going to analyze the retrieved tweets,perform data cleaning,data wrangling,data modeling and present the final study with visualizations.

Stock market prediction is one of the most difficult things to do.There are various causes for this, one is market volatility and next one is variety of dependent and independent variables that creates impact on certain stock in the market.These dependent and independent variables make it difficult for any stock market expert to predict the rise and fall of the market with great precision.The area of stock recommendation consists of research which focuses on two areas one is the stock recommendation methods based on comments in social media or public mood and the second is forecasting the price with comparison to the historical prices.The former method is understandable and is used by the stockholders or investors.In this complicated stock market, the stockholders or investors do not know which one is trustable among the lots of comments and choosing among the comments has a great risk.The next method is difficult for investors to understand,is complex and also needs a lot of mathematical knowledge.A machine learning model that can be used with former method is the solution for this problem. The emotions and moods of individuals are reflected in their tweets and thus affect the decision making process of a few stockholders or investors, which shows there is a direct correlation between public sentiment and market .The sentiment analysis is performed on Twitter data called tweets to find the public mood.Using the Textblob the global polarity is checked and based on it stock recommendations are made.
